## Work Experience
**Solutions Design Engineer @ Amazon Robotics (_May 2022 – Present_)**
- Responsible for designing, analyzing, deploying, and optimizing Robotic Sortation Solutions for the Amazon Fulfillment Network in North America (US and Canada) and Europe.

**Technical Process Engineer @ GlaxoSmithKline (_June 2020 – Dec 2020_)**
- Lead and supported technical projects focused on improving the manufacturing site's preparedness, reliability, and costs.

**Process & Quality Engineering Future Leader GMS @ GlaxoSmithKline (_May 2017 – May 2020_)**
- Lead and supported projects focused on improving the manufacturing site's door-to-door supply chain operations and costs.

## Academic Projects

The following projects were developed during my MS in Industrial Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.

**Customer Subscription Cancellation Predictability** 
- Developed, optimized and analyzed the performance of three supervised learning models (linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree) using R to predict customer subscription cancellations of a Telecommunications Company. All three models resulted in a cut-off point with 80% accuracy.

**The African Tanker Problem**
- Developed a Discrete Simulation Model with Arena Simulation Software that was able to accurately represent the problem from Law (2015). This problem describes the operations from a port in Africa which loads different types of tankers with oil. Ran additional simulations to evaluate how different number of resources affected the port's operations.

**Inbound/ Outbound Truck Operations Modelling and Improvement**
- Developed a Discrete Simulation Model of the inbound/ outbound truck operations in a high-throughput warehouse facility. Three models with different number of resources and process paths were developed to evaluate which provided the highest operational throughput. Performed a one-way ANOVA analysis to determine if the models were significantly different.

**Cyber-Physical Systems Security**
- Modeled a Cyber-Physical System cyber-attack and detection system through mathematical models using MATLAB Simulink. Testing Data that mimicked attacks to the System were modeled using Time-Series models (Prophet, ARIMA). Different detection mechanisms were developed from supervised learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks and evaluated based on their accuracy.

## Research Projects
- Worked alongside Assistant Professor Gian-Gabriel Garcia, PhD at Georgia Tech on developing descriptive statistics and initial predictive models for concussion management in High School Athletes (Fall 2021 and Spring 2022).
